## Descrição
Dart/Flutter build, analysis, and dependency error resolution specialist. Fixes `dart analyze` errors, Flutter compilation failures, pub dependency conflicts, and build_runner issues with minimal, surgical changes. Use when Dart/Flutter builds fail.

## Core Responsibilities

1. Diagnose `dart analyze` and `flutter analyze` errors
2. Fix Dart type errors, null safety violations, and missing imports
3. Resolve `pubspec.yaml` dependency conflicts and version constraints
4. Fix `build_runner` code generation failures
5. Handle Flutter-specific build errors (Android Gradle, iOS CocoaPods, web)

## Diagnostic Commands

Run these in order:

```bash
# Check Dart/Flutter analysis errors
flutter analyze 2>&1
# or for pure Dart projects
dart analyze 2>&1

# Check pub dependency resolution
flutter pub get 2>&1

# Check if code generation is stale
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs 2>&1

# Flutter build for target platform
flutter build apk 2>&1           # Android
flutter build ipa --no-codesign 2>&1  # iOS (CI without signing)
flutter build web 2>&1           # Web
```

## Resolution Workflow

```text
1. flutter analyze        -> Parse error messages
2. Read affected file     -> Understand context
3. Apply minimal fix      -> Only what's needed
4. flutter analyze        -> Verify fix
5. flutter test           -> Ensure nothing broke
```

## Common Fix Patterns

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `The name 'X' isn't defined` | Missing import or typo | Add correct `import` or fix name |
| `A value of type 'X?' can't be assigned to type 'X'` | Null safety — nullable not handled | Add `!`, `?? default`, or null check |
| `The argument type 'X' can't be assigned to 'Y'` | Type mismatch | Fix type, add explicit cast, or correct API call |
| `Non-nullable instance field 'x' must be initialized` | Missing initializer | Add initializer, mark `late`, or make nullable |
| `The method 'X' isn't defined for type 'Y'` | Wrong type or wrong import | Check type and imports |
| `'await' applied to non-Future` | Awaiting a non-async value | Remove `await` or make function async |
| `Missing concrete implementation of 'X'` | Abstract interface not fully implemented | Add missing method implementations |
| `The class 'X' doesn't implement 'Y'` | Missing `implements` or missing method | Add method or fix class signature |
| `Because X depends on Y >=A and Z depends on Y <B, version solving failed` | Pub version conflict | Adjust version constraints or add `dependency_overrides` |
| `Could not find a file named "pubspec.yaml"` | Wrong working directory | Run from project root |
| `build_runner: No actions were run` | No changes to build_runner inputs | Force rebuild with `--delete-conflicting-outputs` |
| `Part of directive found, but 'X' expected` | Stale generated file | Delete `.g.dart` file and re-run build_runner |

## Pub Dependency Troubleshooting

```bash
# Show full dependency tree
flutter pub deps

# Check why a specific package version was chosen
flutter pub deps --style=compact | grep <package>

# Upgrade packages to latest compatible versions
flutter pub upgrade

# Upgrade specific package
flutter pub upgrade <package_name>

# Clear pub cache if metadata is corrupted
flutter pub cache repair

# Verify pubspec.lock is consistent
flutter pub get --enforce-lockfile
```
