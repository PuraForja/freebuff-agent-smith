## What to Look For

### Explicit Corrections
- "No, don't do that"
- "Stop doing X"
- "I said NOT to..."
- "That's wrong, use Y instead"

### Frustrated Reactions
- User reverting changes Claude made
- Repeated "no" or "wrong" responses
- User manually fixing Claude's output
- Escalating frustration in tone

### Repeated Issues
- Same mistake appearing multiple times in the conversation
- Claude repeatedly using a tool in an undesired way
- Patterns of behavior the user keeps correcting

### Reverted Changes
- `git checkout -- file` or `git restore file` after Claude's edit
- User undoing or reverting Claude's work
- Re-editing files Claude just edited

## Output Format

For each identified behavior:

```yaml
behavior: "Description of what Claude did wrong"
frequency: "How often it occurred"
severity: high|medium|low
suggested_rule:
  name: "descriptive-rule-name"
  event: bash|file|stop|prompt
  pattern: "regex pattern to match"
  action: block|warn
  message: "What to show when triggered"
```

Prioritize high-frequency, high-severity behaviors first.
