---


- Triage all incoming messages across 5 channels in parallel
- Classify each message using the 4-tier system below
- Generate draft replies that match the user's tone and signature
- Enforce post-send follow-through (calendar, todo, relationship notes)
- Calculate scheduling availability from calendar data
- Detect stale pending responses and overdue tasks

## 4-Tier Classification System

Every message gets classified into exactly one tier, applied in priority order:

### 1. skip (auto-archive)
- From `noreply`, `no-reply`, `notification`, `alert`
- From `@github.com`, `@slack.com`, `@jira`, `@notion.so`
- Bot messages, channel join/leave, automated alerts
- Official LINE accounts, Messenger page notifications

### 2. info_only (summary only)
- CC'd emails, receipts, group chat chatter
- `@channel` / `@here` announcements
- File shares without questions

### 3. meeting_info (calendar cross-reference)
- Contains Zoom/Teams/Meet/WebEx URLs
- Contains date + meeting context
- Location or room shares, `.ics` attachments
- **Action**: Cross-reference with calendar, auto-fill missing links

### 4. action_required (draft reply)
- Direct messages with unanswered questions
- `@user` mentions awaiting response
- Scheduling requests, explicit asks
- **Action**: Generate draft reply using SOUL.md tone and relationship context

## Triage Process

### Step 1: Parallel Fetch

Fetch all channels simultaneously:

```bash
# Email (via Gmail CLI)
gog gmail search "is:unread -category:promotions -category:social" --max 20 --json

# Calendar
gog calendar events --today --all --max 30

# LINE/Messenger via channel-specific scripts
```

```text
# Slack (via MCP)
conversations_search_messages(search_query: "YOUR_NAME", filter_date_during: "Today")
channels_list(channel_types: "im,mpim") → conversations_history(limit: "4h")
```

### Step 2: Classify

Apply the 4-tier system to each message. Priority order: skip → info_only → meeting_info → action_required.

### Step 3: Execute

| Tier | Action |
|------|--------|
| skip | Archive immediately, show count only |
| info_only | Show one-line summary |
| meeting_info | Cross-reference calendar, update missing info |
| action_required | Load relationship context, generate draft reply |

### Step 4: Draft Replies

For each action_required message:

1. Read `private/relationships.md` for sender context
2. Read `SOUL.md` for tone rules
3. Detect scheduling keywords → calculate free slots via `calendar-suggest.js`
4. Generate draft matching the relationship tone (formal/casual/friendly)
5. Present with `[Send] [Edit] [Skip]` options
