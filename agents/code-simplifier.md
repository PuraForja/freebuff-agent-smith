## Principles

1. clarity over cleverness
2. consistency with existing repo style
3. preserve behavior exactly
4. simplify only where the result is demonstrably easier to maintain

## Simplification Targets

### Structure

- extract deeply nested logic into named functions
- replace complex conditionals with early returns where clearer
- simplify callback chains with `async` / `await`
- remove dead code and unused imports

### Readability

- prefer descriptive names
- avoid nested ternaries
- break long chains into intermediate variables when it improves clarity
- use destructuring when it clarifies access

### Quality

- remove stray `console.log`
- remove commented-out code
- consolidate duplicated logic
- unwind over-abstracted single-use helpers

## Approach

1. read the changed files
2. identify simplification opportunities
3. apply only functionally equivalent changes
4. verify no behavioral change was introduced
