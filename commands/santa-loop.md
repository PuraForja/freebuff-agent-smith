# Santa Loop

Adversarial dual-review convergence loop using the santa-method skill. Two independent reviewers — different models, no shared context — must both return NICE before code ships.

## Purpose

Run two independent reviewers (Claude Opus + an external model) against the current task output. Both must return NICE before the code is pushed. If either returns NAUGHTY, fix all flagged issues, commit, and re-run fresh reviewers — up to 3 rounds.

## Usage

```
/santa-loop [file-or-glob | description]
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify What to Review

Determine the scope from `$ARGUMENTS` or fall back to uncommitted changes:

```bash
git diff --name-only HEAD
```

Read all changed files to build the full review context. If `$ARGUMENTS` specifies a path, file, or description, use that as the scope instead.

### Step 2: Build the Rubric

Construct a rubric appropriate to the file types under review. Every criterion must have an objective PASS/FAIL condition. Include at minimum:

| Criterion | Pass Condition |
|-----------|---------------|
| Correctness | Logic is sound, no bugs, handles edge cases |
| Security | No secrets, injection, XSS, or OWASP Top 10 issues |
| Error handling | Errors handled explicitly, no silent swallowing |
| Completeness | All requirements addressed, no missing cases |
| Internal consistency | No contradictions between files or sections |
| No regressions | Changes don't break existing behavior |

Add domain-specific criteria based on file types (e.g., type safety for TS, memory safety for Rust, migration safety for SQL).

### Step 3: Dual Independent Review

Launch two reviewers **in parallel** using the Agent tool (both in a single message for concurrent execution). Both must complete before proceeding to the verdict gate.

Each reviewer evaluates every rubric criterion as PASS or FAIL, then returns structured JSON:

```json
{
  "verdict": "PASS" | "FAIL",
  "checks": [
    {"criterion": "...", "result": "PASS|FAIL", "detail": "..."}
  ],
  "critical_issues": ["..."],
  "suggestions": ["..."]
}
```

The verdict gate (Step 4) maps these to NICE/NAUGHTY: both PASS → NICE, either FAIL → NAUGHTY.

#### Reviewer A: Claude Agent (always runs)

Launch an Agent (subagent_type: `code-reviewer`, model: `opus`) with the full rubric + all files under review. The prompt must include:
- The complete rubric
- All file contents under review
- "You are an independent quality reviewer. You have NOT seen any other review. Your job is to find problems, not to approve."
- Return the structured JSON verdict above

#### Reviewer B: External Model (Claude fallback only if no external CLI installed)

First, detect which CLIs are available:
```bash
command -v codex >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "codex" || true
command -v gemini >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "gemini" || true
```
