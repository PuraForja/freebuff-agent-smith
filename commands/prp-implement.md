# PRP Implement

Execute a plan file step-by-step with continuous validation. Every change is verified immediately — never accumulate broken state.

**Core Philosophy**: Validation loops catch mistakes early. Run checks after every change. Fix issues immediately.

**Golden Rule**: If a validation fails, fix it before moving on. Never accumulate broken state.

## Phase 0 — DETECT

### Package Manager Detection

| File Exists | Package Manager | Runner |
|---|---|---|
| `bun.lockb` | bun | `bun run` |
| `pnpm-lock.yaml` | pnpm | `pnpm run` |
| `yarn.lock` | yarn | `yarn` |
| `package-lock.json` | npm | `npm run` |
| `pyproject.toml` or `requirements.txt` | uv / pip | `uv run` or `python -m` |
| `Cargo.toml` | cargo | `cargo` |
| `go.mod` | go | `go` |

### Validation Scripts

Check `package.json` (or equivalent) for available scripts:

```bash
# For Node.js projects
cat package.json | grep -A 20 '"scripts"'
```

Note available commands for: type-check, lint, test, build.

---

## Phase 1 — LOAD

Read the plan file:

```bash
cat "$ARGUMENTS"
```

Extract these sections from the plan:
- **Summary** — What is being built
- **Patterns to Mirror** — Code conventions to follow
- **Files to Change** — What to create or modify
- **Step-by-Step Tasks** — Implementation sequence
- **Validation Commands** — How to verify correctness
- **Acceptance Criteria** — Definition of done

If the file doesn't exist or isn't a valid plan:
```
Error: Plan file not found or invalid.
Run /prp-plan <feature-description> to create a plan first.
```

**CHECKPOINT**: Plan loaded. All sections identified. Tasks extracted.

---

## Phase 2 — PREPARE

### Git State

```bash
git branch --show-current
git status --porcelain
```

### Branch Decision
