## Descrição

Expert guidance for developing with the tinystruct Java framework. Use when working on the tinystruct codebase or any project built on tinystruct — including creating Application classes, @Action-mapped routes, unit tests, ActionRegistry, HTTP/CLI dual-mode handling, the built-in HTTP server, the event system, JSON with Builder/Builders, database persistence with AbstractData, POJO generation, Server-Sent Events (SSE), file uploads, and outbound HTTP networking.

# tinystruct Development Patterns

Architecture and implementation patterns for building modules with the **tinystruct** Java framework – a lightweight, high-performance framework that treats CLI and HTTP as equal citizens, requiring no `main()` method and minimal configuration.

## Core Principle

**CLI and HTTP are equal citizens.** Every method annotated with `@Action` should ideally be runnable from both a terminal and a web browser without modification. This "dual-mode" capability is the core design philosophy of tinystruct.

## When to Activate

### When to Use

- Creating new `Application` modules by extending `AbstractApplication`.
- Defining routes and command-line actions using `@Action`.
- Handling per-request state via `Context`.
- Performing JSON serialization using the native `Builder` and `Builders` components.
- Working with database persistence via `AbstractData` POJOs.
- Generating POJOs from database tables using the `generate` command.
- Implementing Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time push.
- Handling file uploads via multipart data.
- Making outbound HTTP requests with `URLRequest` and `HTTPHandler`.
- Configuring database connections or system settings in `application.properties`.
- Debugging routing conflicts (Actions) or CLI argument parsing.

## How It Works

The tinystruct framework treats any method annotated with `@Action` as a routable endpoint for both terminal and web environments. Applications are created by extending `AbstractApplication`, which provides core lifecycle hooks like `init()` and access to the request `Context`.

Routing is handled by the `ActionRegistry`, which automatically maps path segments to method arguments and injects dependencies. For data-only services, the native `Builder` and `Builders` components should be used for JSON serialization to maintain a zero-dependency footprint. The database layer uses `AbstractData` POJOs paired with XML mapping files for CRUD operations without external ORM libraries.

## Examples

### Basic Application (MyService)
```java
public class MyService extends AbstractApplication {
    @Override
    public void init() {
        this.setTemplateRequired(false); // Disable .view lookup for data/API apps
    }

    @Override public String version() { return "1.0.0"; }

    @Action("greet")
    public String greet() {
        return "Hello from tinystruct!";
    }

    // Path parameter: GET /?q=greet/James  OR  bin/dispatcher greet/James
    @Action("greet")
    public String greet(String name) {
        return "Hello, " + name + "!";
    }
}
```

### HTTP Mode Disambiguation (login)
```java
@Action(value = "login", mode = Mode.HTTP_POST)
public String doLogin(Request<?, ?> request) throws ApplicationException {
    request.getSession().setAttribute("userId", "42");
    return "Logged in";
}
```

### Native JSON Data Handling (Builder + Builders)
```java
import org.tinystruct.data.component.Builder;
import org.tinystruct.data.component.Builders;

@Action("api/data
